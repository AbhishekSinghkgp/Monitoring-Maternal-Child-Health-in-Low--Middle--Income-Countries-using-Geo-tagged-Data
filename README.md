# Monitoring-Maternal-Child-Health-in-Low--Middle--Income-Countries-using-Geo-tagged-Data

Accurately predicting health indicators is a task of utmost importance, when it
 comes to understanding the well-being of a society. Especially in low- & middle
income countries (LMICs), where monitoring maternal & child health (MCH) can
 play a crucial role in the development and prosperity of people. In such countries,
 physical surveys in the past, have been able to sample only a tiny fraction of the
 entire nation. Our aim is to demonstrate that machine learning and deep learning
 when applied to geo-tagged datasets can accurately estimate key indicators to
 monitor maternal & child health efficiently. Our main contribution is utilizing
 geotagged datasets to accurately predict MCH indicators. We obtain our best results
 using SHAP library for feature selection and LightGBM as the main model.
